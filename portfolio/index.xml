      <description>Circuits processing proprioceptive information face two important challenges. First, proprioceptive processing must be fast: animals often only have a few hundred milliseconds to integrate information from disparate proprioceptors before relaying that information to motor circuits. Second, proprioceptive processing must be flexible: the influence of proprioceptive feedback should change with behavioral context. For example, when maintaining posture, a high feedback gain will help animals oppose any perturbations. In contrast, when walking, a low feedback gain will allow animals to ignore expected limb movement.</description>

      <description>Proprioception, the sense of body movement and position, is critical for movement in all animals. However, it is perhaps the most poorly understood of the primary senses. In particular, we know very little about how proprioception is processed within circuits of the central nervous system: these circuits are embedded within the vertebrate spinal cord or the analogous invertebrate ventral nerve cord (VNC), where they are difficult to access and record from, we lack knowledge about how these sensorimotor circuits are organized, and there is a paucity of genetic tools that label the relevant cell-types.</description>

      <description>One of the primary specializations of true flies (order Diptera) is the modification of the hind wings into club-shaped halteres. Although the halteres do not generate lift, they experience multiple inertial forces during flight. Mechanosensory cells at the haltere base detect the cuticular deformations caused by these forces. This sensory information is sent to motor neurons that steer the wings and stabilize the fly&amp;rsquo;s gaze. If the halteres are removed, flies are unable to maintain stable flight.</description>

      <title>Sensory cues and courtship</title>

      <description>As a graduate student, I built a modifiable, programmable fly dummy that, when coupled with automated behavioral tracking, revealed how male Drosophila melanogaster use visual and chemosensory cues to dynamically modulate their ability to find and chase mates. Drosophila courtship has long been a model for how neural circuits enable complex, sequential behaviors. However, previous courtship studies did not account for how sensory cues are temporally and spatially encountered by male Drosophila during courtship, nor did they measure the effect of visual cues.</description>

      <title>Active learning reduces learning gaps</title>
      <link>https://sagrawal.github.io/portfolio/active/</link>

      <description>Low-income and racial and ethnic minority (URM) students are sorely underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Much of this underrepresentation is due to attrition stemming from achievement gaps like lower exam scores and higher failure rates. Changes in course instruction, like a switch to active learning, have been shown to increase performance and passing rates for all students. We wondered whether active learning may disprorportionately benefit URM students.
As part of this collaborative effort, I read through the educational research literature and coded and quantified those studies that addressed the effect of on student performance when implementating either active learning or traditional lecturing within the same course.</description>
